# Evaluation-of-DNA-Methylation-Episignatures_spring_2021_project

Workflow to generate and validate episignatures from Illumina 450K methylation data

Aim: 
To develop a standardised workflow to generate and validate episignatures

Objectives:
Epigenetics array Illumina 450K normalisation and QC
Differential methylation analysis with R::LIMMA 
Construction of a classification algorithm for all of the episignatures using Random Forest

For this analysis GSE97362 data  from Illumina 450K was used. An approach using the limma package in R was used to determine a set of differentially expressed signatures for CHARGE and Kabuki genetic syndromes. After that, construction of a classification algorithm for all of the episignatures using Random Forest was implemented.
